# ZipMan-using-Huffman-Coding

The File Zipper project is an online application that utilizes Huffman encoding to compress and decompress files. It provides a user-friendly interface to encode and decode various file types, such as txt, png, jpeg, jpg, and pdf. The project is deployed globally and accessible via the following link: [File Zipper](https://file-zipper.nandhakrishna.repl.co/).

## Features

1. **Huffman Encoding**: The application uses Huffman encoding algorithm to compress input files efficiently.

2. **Support for Multiple File Types**: The project supports various file types including txt, png, jpeg, jpg, and pdf for compression and decompression.

3. **Max File Size Alert**: An alert box is displayed if the input file size exceeds a specified maximum limit.

4. **Merging Multiple Files**: In case of multiple input files, the application merges their contents into a single file before compression.

5. **User-friendly Interface**: The web-based interface ensures ease of use for both compression and decompression tasks.

## Usage

1. **Compression**: To compress a file, simply select the desired file from your device using the "Choose File" button. The application will automatically encode the file using Huffman encoding and provide a compressed output file for download.

2. **Decompression**: To decompress a previously compressed file, select the compressed file using the "Choose File" button. The application will decode the file and generate the original file for download.

3. **Merging Files**: If you need to compress multiple files together, select all the files you want to merge using the "Choose File" button. The application will merge their contents into a single file and then compress it using Huffman encoding.
